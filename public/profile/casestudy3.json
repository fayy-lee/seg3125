    "casestudy3": "Hey there! I'm Fay Lee, a Computer Science student at the University of Ottawa, fueled by the mission of leveraging technology for good.\n\nIn my academic journey, I've delved into various realms of computer science, mastering algorithms, software engineering, and more.\n\n I've brought ideas to life through projects like a Hotel Management System and a Healthcare Appointment Management System, aimed at streamlining processes and enhancing user experiences. Plus, myFirstFinance, born from a hackathon, merges React and Next.js to empower users with financial insights.\n\nBeyond academics, I'm deeply engaged in campus activities, taking lead in organizing MLH hackathons, contributing to Canada's largest student-run software engineering conference, and coordinating events for computer science students at uOttawa. Whether it's rallying students for causes or nurturing community connections, I find fulfillment in making a meaningful impact.\n\nIf you share a passion for tech-driven change or just want to connect, let's chat!.",
