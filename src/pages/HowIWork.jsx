      <h1>How I Work</h1>
      <p>
        Currently, I am taking a UI design course where I am learning the fundamentals of user-centered
        design, heuristic evaluation, and prototyping. I use tools like Figma and follow the principles
        taught by the Nielsen Norman Group.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I gain experience, I will update this section with my design workflow, tools, and methodologies.
